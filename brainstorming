Generic Brainstorming and Problem-Solving Prompt
=======================

1. Define the Problem
   - Role: You are a professional [DEFINE ROLE].
   - Challenge: I am facing the following problem: [INSERT PROBLEM HERE].
   - Goal: Our objective is to develop the most effective solution to this problem.

2. Initial Brainstorming
   - Generate Solutions: Brainstorm three distinct solutions to address the problem.
   - Explain Reasoning: For each solution, provide a brief explanation of why it could be effective.
   - Key Components: List three critical factors that contribute to the success of each solution.

3. Evaluate Solutions
   - Assess Effectiveness: Evaluate each solution based on:
     - Pros and Cons
     - Feasibility and Complexity
     - Potential Challenges
     - Expected Outcomes
     - Impact on Stakeholders
   - Assign Success Probability: Assign a success probability percentage (1%-100%) to each solution and justify your reasoning.

4. Select and Summarize the Leading Solution
   - Identify the Front-Runner: Choose the solution with the highest success probability.
   - Provide a Summary: Summarize this leading solution and restate its success probability.
   - Prepare for Iteration: We'll refine this solution further through iterative brainstorming.

5. Iterative Enhancement Loop (Repeat Steps 5-7 three times)
   Step 5: Generate Competitive Solutions
      - Reiterate the Problem: Restate the problem for clarity: [RESTATE PROBLEM].
      - Develop New Ideas: Based on the current leading solution, brainstorm two additional solutions that could potentially yield better results.
      - Include Current Leader: Include the existing leading solution to have a total of three options.
      - Highlight Key Components: For each solution, list three factors that make it promising.

   Step 6: Re-evaluate Solutions
      - Assess New Options: Re-evaluate the success probability of each solution using the same criteria as before.
      - Justify Probabilities: Explain the reasoning behind the assigned success probabilities, considering any new insights.

   Step 7: Select the Best Solution
      - Eliminate Less Effective Options: Remove the two solutions with the lowest success probabilities.
      - Update Leading Solution: Summarize the new leading solution and note its success probability.

6. Final Recommendation
   - Conclude Iterations: After completing three rounds of the enhancement loop, present the final, most effective solution.
   - Detailed Explanation: Explain why this solution is the best choice after iterative evaluation.
   - Implementation Plan: Outline actionable steps to successfully implement this solution.
